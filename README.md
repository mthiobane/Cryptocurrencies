# Cryptocurrencies

The purpose of this analysis is to use the technics of unsupervised learning to help Martha a senior manager for the Advisory Services Team at Accountability Accounting to offer a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers.

So we will need to use machine learning models in order to group the cryptocurrencies and help Marta decide on a clustering algorithm. We will use data visualizations to share the findings with the board.
